This is an image slider made with Javascript and SCSS. It is part of The Odin Project JavaScript section https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/dynamic-user-interface-interactions.

Slide transitions actually slide in and out, including when transitioning between last and first - it slides in a loop.
It plays automatically and also has two different types of navigation. Forward and back buttons do just that.
The dot navigation either uses a slide transition if the selected image is adjacent or it has a fade transition if the selected image is not adjacent.
